CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:25 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcpprestsdk.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "cpprestsdk", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "cpprestsdk" with
  any of the following names:

    cpprestsdkConfig.cmake
    cpprestsdk-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "cpprestsdk" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "cpprestsdk_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "cpprestsdk" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.

CMake Warning (dev) at /snap/clion/126/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.17/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:272 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (XMLTO) does
  not match the name of the calling package (XmlTo).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  rabbitmq-c/cmake/FindXmlTo.cmake:13 (FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS)
  rabbitmq-c/CMakeLists.txt:253 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
